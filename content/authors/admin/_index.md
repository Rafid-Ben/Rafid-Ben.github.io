## About Me

Salam/Hello!

I am Rafid Bendimerad, a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. My research involves several aspects related to space propulsion, including: on-orbit refueling, discovery of new propellants for propulsion systems using Machine Learning (ML), and modeling and simulation of electrospray thruster plumes using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and N-body simulations. 

Besides my research, I like sharing scientific content on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rafidbendimerad).
