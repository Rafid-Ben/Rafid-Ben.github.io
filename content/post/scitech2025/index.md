I had the chance to attend the AIAA SciTech Forum 2025 in Orlando, Florida. This picture is with Professor Fabien Royer, Professor Sadaf Sobhani, Professor Elaine Petro, and some of their respective students. SciTech is the largest conference in Aerospace Engineering in the world; the edition of 2025 gathered nearly 6,200 attendees and 117 sponsors and exhibitors from 51 countries.
