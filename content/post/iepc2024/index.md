Today, I had the opportunity to present my work at the 38th edition of the International Electric Propulsion Conference (IEPC2024), which is the biggest gathering of the electric propulsion community from all over the world. This edition took place in Toulouse, France – the European capital of aeronautics and astronautics. 

I presented my work titled “Predicting the Suitability of Ionic Liquids for Electrospray Propulsion Using Machine Learning”. This work was directly inspired by previous efforts in the domain of cheminformatics applied for drug discovery. However, instead of looking for molecules that could constitute drugs for certain diseases, this work looks for molecules that could serve as good propellants for electrospray thrusters that are used for micropropulsion of satellites in space missions.
