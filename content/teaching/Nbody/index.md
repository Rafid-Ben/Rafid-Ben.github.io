In this tutorial, we'll guide you through simulating the expansion of a plume from an electrospray thruster. Learn to:

- Set initial emission conditions
- Describe external electric fields
- Model molecule fragmentation
- Compute forces on particles
- Update particle positions
- Visualize particle propagation in 2D and 3D
